Requires library lsndfile for reading wav files...
on ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev

to compile: 
	g++ convolve.cpp -lsndfile

tested on: 
	osx
	ubuntu vm on windows 
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=968690

included important files:
	report
	readme
	convolve.cpp
	main.cpp
	utils.cpp
	libsndfile-1.0.26   (for osx, enter the folder and run './configure; make; make install' as defined in the library's readme)
	tabla.wav
	irBIGHALL
	
Decisions:
	reading wav iles uses lsndfile library,
	writing wav files uses code from tutorials and is in utils.cpp
	sound files used were tabla.wav and irBIGALL, both were provided on d2l.

	fourier transformation was one found online which also in C textbook.

	All optimization changes were made in convolve.cpp, as such only multiple versions of that file are included.
